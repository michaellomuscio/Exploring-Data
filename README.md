# Exploring-Data
This repository contains sample code for my Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning Course. Using a modified Pokémon dataset acquired from Kaggle.com, example code is provided for students demonstrating how to explore data with R.

I acquired the data from Alberto Barradas at https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon. I renamed some of the variables and removed the Total variable. Barradas provides the following description of each variable. I have modified the variable names to make them easier to deal with.

•	Num: ID for each Pokémon.
•	Name: Name of each Pokémon.
•	Type1: Each Pokémon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks.
•	Type2: Some Pokémon are dual type and have 2.
•	HP: Hit points, or health, defines how much damage a Pokémon can withstand before fainting.
•	Attack: The base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch).
•	Defense: The base damage resistance against normal attacks.
•	SPAtk: Special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam).
•	SPDef: The base damage resistance against special attacks.
•	Speed: Determines which Pokémon attacks first each round.
•	Generation: Number of generation.
•	Legendary: True if Legendary Pokémon, False if not.
